Dice roller adds an option to nodes and comments to provide an integrated dice roller. The dice roller options are based on the standards set at http://openrpg.com for dice rolling in an online environment. Open RPG is released under GNU GPL.

Once the roll is made there is no option for the user to go back to remove the roll from the post nor any option to modify the roll. This is to prevent tampering with results in order to negate the risk of cheating.
